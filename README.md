## Class Exercise 2: Guardian API

Because of AI recently emerging as a easy accessible tool for everday tasks and thus being a hot topic in society for the last few months, we analyze the press coverage about artificial intelligence from September 2022 to April 2023. We address the questions like "does the press emphasize more on potential chances or threats of AI/ChatGPT or "does the coverage with time get more negative towards AI".
