# Class Exercise 2

## 1. Introduction
Because of AI recently emerging as a easy accessible tool for everday tasks and thus being a hot topic in society for the last few months, we analyze the press coverage about artificial intelligence from September 2022 to April 2023. We address the questions like "Does the press emphasize more on potential chances or threats of AI/ChatGPT?" or "Does the coverage with time get more negative towards AI?".

Our goal is 
1) To show how sentiment towards AI has shifted in press outlets from September 2022 to April 2023
2) To show how the frequency of press coverage of AI has changed over that same time period
## 2. Methods
We set out to answer these two questions by first doing a sentiment analysis and secondly by doing a frequency analysis.
But how do we get there?
